        " Gen AI and LLMs create output based on existing content, whether that comes from the open internet or the specific datasets that they have been trained on. That means they are good at iterating on what came before, which can be a boon for attackers. For example, in the same way that AI can create iterations of content using the same set of words, it can create malicious code that is similar to something that already exists, but different enough to evade detection. With this technology, bad actors will generate unique payloads or attacks designed to evade security defenses that are built around known attack signatures.One way attackers are already doing this is by using AI to develop webshell variants, malicious code used to maintain persistence on compromised servers. Attackers can input the existing webshell into a generative AI tool and ask it to create iterations of the malicious code. These variants can then be used, often in conjunction with a remote code execution vulnerability (RCE), on a compromised server to evade detection. \"\"\",\n",

Their size is enabled by AI accelerators, which are able to process vast amounts of text data, mostly scraped from the Internet. The artificial neural networks which are built can contain from tens of millions and up to billions of weights and are (pre-)trained using self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning. Transformer architecture contributed to faster training. Alternative architectures include the mixture of experts (MoE), which has been proposed by Google, starting with sparsely-gated ones in 2017, Gshard in 2021 to GLaM in 2022.\n",

Up to 2020, fine tuning was the only way a model could be adapted to be able to accomplish specific tasks. Larger sized models, such as GPT-3, however, can be prompt-engineered to achieve similar results. They are thought to acquire embodied knowledge about syntax, semantics and \\\"ontology\\\" inherent in human language corpora, but also inaccuracies and biases present in the corpora.\n",
